Vending Machine Kata Project 

For the purpose of this task. I will put the requirements in the README
Requirements: 

As a vendor
I want customers to select products
So that I can give them an incentive to put money in the machine

As a vendor
I want customers to receive correct change
So that they will use the vending machine again

As a customer
I want to be told when the item I have selected is not available
So that I can select another item

As a customer
I want to be told when exact change is required
So that I can determine if I can buy something with the money I have before inserting it

My Approach: 
I wanted to go down the 'Onion' approach with adding fucntionality. Even if the initial approach would need refactoring later on. 
It was important for me to be able to test and debug each stage successfully before mocing on to the next 


I had limited time for this task. Which is why it isn't perfect. I tried to sray within the time limit.
Things that I would want to improve on if I had more time would be: 
1) Removing all debug code 
2) Removing the program.cs and placing all code within the VendingMachine.cs file 
3) Make actual coin inputs for 5p,10p,20p ect. Then caulculate the actual curreny amount expect (150p = Â£1.50)

This is a Work in progress. All changes in this branch were solving the issues above. As well refactoring existing code to be more clean and standardised.
